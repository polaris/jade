# Implementations of basic containers

This project is about learning about basic data structures and how to implement them in modern C++. The classes resemble the interfaces of the STL containers. However, this project is not about creating a complete STL implementation.

Objectives:
* learn about data structures
* learn about algorithmic complexity
* learn about modern C++
* learn about the STL
